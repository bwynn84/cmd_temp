To use this program you need your own api (free) key from https://openweathermap.org/api

You also need the libcurl and jsoncpp libraries
https://curl.haxx.se/

This is only a simple command line tool that will tell you the current temperature. I wrote this to play with other libraries and so I wouldn't get rusty from not coding as much.

To run type, ./cmd_temp [then zip code]
for example: ./cmd_temp 90210

It will show you:
The temperature for Beverly Hills is 55Â° F.


Note: this only works for the U.S.
